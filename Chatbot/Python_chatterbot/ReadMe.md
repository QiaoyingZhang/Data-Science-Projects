# Train Chatbot With Python ChatterBot Library

## About ChatterBot
ChatterBot is an open-source library and can be easily integrated into various Python applications, including web applications, chat applications, and more. It is a valuable tool for building chatbots, virtual assistants, or any other application that requires natural language understanding and generation. ChatterBot uses NLP techniques and libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) to process and understand text input. It uses rule-based methods, machine learning-based approaches, and more to generate responses to user queries. Nonetheless, ChatterBot maintains a conversation history to enable context-aware responses. This means that the chatbot can remember previous messages in a conversation and respond accordingly.

### Prerequisites
The simple_bot.py needs to use a Python version below 3.8 to successfully work with the recommended version of ChatterBot. You can install Python 3.7.9 using pyenv-win.

## Dataset
The dataset *Dataset for chatbot* by Graf Stor, available on Kaggle, is derived from a website containing straightforward dialogues designed for beginners, and it serves as valuable training data for chatbot development.

## Purpose of Project
The primary objective of undertaking this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the inner workings of chatbots and, in particular, the ChatterBot library. By delving into the intricacies of ChatterBot, I aim to acquire valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms and algorithms that power conversational agents. With this knowledge, my goal is to embark on the exciting journey of creating my own chatbot, leveraging the methods and techniques employed by ChatterBot as a foundation. This hands-on experience will provide me with the opportunity to customize and tailor the chatbot to suit my specific needs, ultimately enabling me to develop a conversational agent that can engage users effectively and provide meaningful responses. Through this project, I aspire to hone my skills in natural language processing and artificial intelligence, paving the way for the development of a chatbot that is both informative and user-friendly.
